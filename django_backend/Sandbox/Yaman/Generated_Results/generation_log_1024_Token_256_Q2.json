The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.",

Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing\nregulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.",

More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.",

Some firms\nrequire an MBA or several years of business experience for their financial analysts.\n1.4 • Careers in Finance\n19\nFigure 1.6 Financial Analyst Tasks\nInternal financial analysts are important for a successful firm or organization because their work can lead to\nmore efficient and cost-effective use of financial and nonfinancial resources. Responsibilities include keeping\ncurrent with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and\noutcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports. Various government agencies also use financial analysts to aid in regulatory oversight and\nenforcement.\nA report from a 2019 BLS survey determines that financial analysts earn an average salary of $81,590, and jobs\nare predicted to grow at a faster-than-average rate of 5% through 2029.5\nBusiness (or Management) Analyst Roles\nThe job description for a business analyst looks much like that for a financial analyst. However, the strong\nquantitative skills required for a financial analyst are less emphasized in favor of overall strategic thinking. A\nsuccessful business analyst is able to evaluate business opportunities by using analytical thinking, industry\nbest practices, process development, team building and organization, and information technology. They then\ncommunicate optimal courses of action to executive decision makers to maximize value in alignment with the\nvision and goals of the firm.\nBusiness analysts can help develop strategy and tactics to move a firm forward. They aid in identifying\nchallenges and solutions. Data-driven solutions help get products to market more quickly, evaluate\nperformance, and optimize production and product mix. The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies the following\nas typical business analyst duties:\n•\nGathering information about problems to be solved or procedures to be improved\n•\nInterviewing personnel and conducting onsite observations to determine the methods, equipment, and\n5\nIbid.\n20\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npersonnel that will be needed\n•\nAnalyzing financial data, revenues and expenditures, and employment reports, among other data\n•\nFinding root causes for problems and proposing solutions that may include new systems, procedures, or\npersonnel changes\n•\nPresenting findings to decision makers\n•\nConferring with managers to ensure changes work\nThe average salary for management analysts was $85,260 in May 2019, and the BLS projects 11% growth, or\nabout 94,000 new jobs, over the next decade.6\n1.5\nMarkets and Participants\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify primary and secondary markets.\n•\nIdentify key market players.\nPrimary and Secondary Markets\nSimply put, the primary market is the market for “new” securities, and the secondary market is the market\nfor “used” securities. Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the",
