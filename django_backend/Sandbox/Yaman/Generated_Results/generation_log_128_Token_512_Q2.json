                    "question": "What is a stock exchange?",
                    "answer": "A stock exchange is an entity that provides services for stock brokers and traders to trade stocks, bonds, and other securities. Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of securities and other financial instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends. Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of such securities and capital events including share issues, rights issues, indirect issuance of securities, and direct issuance of additional stock. Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as open outcry. This method is used in some stock exchanges and commodities exchanges, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the NASDAQ. A potential buyer bids a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller asks a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling at the actual market price (if the bid and ask prices match) can involve the payment of a commission to a broker. Around the turn of the 21st century, commissions were often charged for purchases as percentages of the total trade value. The rise of internet trading in the 1990s, however, significantly lowered brokerage fees and commissions for online purchases. Today there is a clear distinction in how the stock market works – today, trading does not take place on the floor of an exchange, but is done electronically.
