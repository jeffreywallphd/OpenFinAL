In practice, risks are always present in any\nfinancial action and entities.\nDue to its wide scope, a broad range of subfields exists within finance. Asset-, money-, risk- and\ninvestment  management  aim  to  maximize  value  and  minimize  volatility.  Financial  analysis\nassesses  the  viability,  stability,  and  profitability  of  an  action  or  entity.  Some  fields  are\nmultidisciplinary,  such  as  mathematical  finance,  financial  law,  financial  economics,  financial\nengineering and financial technology. These fields are the foundation of business and accounting.\nIn  some  cases,  theories  in  finance  can  be  tested  using  the  scientific  method,  covered  by\nexperimental finance.\nThe early history of finance parallels the early history of money, which is prehistoric. Ancient and\nmedieval  civilizations  incorporated  basic  functions  of  finance,  such  as  banking,  trading  and\naccounting, into their economies. In the late 19th century, the global financial system was formed.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline,[c] separate\nfrom economics.[1] The earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the 1960s and\n1970s.[2] Today, finance is also widely studied through career-focused undergraduate and master's\nlevel programs.[3][4]\nAs outlined, the financial system consists of the flows of capital that take place between individuals\nand  households  (personal  finance),  governments  (public  finance),  and  businesses  (corporate\nfinance). \"Finance\" thus studies the process of channeling money from savers and investors to\nentities that need it.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality\ngrew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was\nIntroduction to Finance\n1\n1 • Why It Matters\n7\ndesigned to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.\nBacon Signs’ ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the\nfirm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and",

Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs).

In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated.

The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by",
