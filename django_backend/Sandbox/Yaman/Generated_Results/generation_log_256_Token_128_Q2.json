In the late 19th century, the global financial system was formed.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline,[c] separate\nfrom economics.[1] The earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the 1960s and\n1970s.[2] Today, finance is also widely studied through career-focused undergraduate and master's\nlevel programs.[3][4]\nAs outlined, the financial system consists of the flows of capital that take place between individuals\nand  households  (personal  finance),  governments  (public  finance),  and  businesses  (corporate\nfinance). \"Finance\" thus studies the process of channeling money from savers and investors to\nentities that need it.
