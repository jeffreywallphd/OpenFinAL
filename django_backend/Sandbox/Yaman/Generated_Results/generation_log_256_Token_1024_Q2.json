In practice, risks are always present in any\nfinancial action and entities.\nDue to its wide scope, a broad range of subfields exists within finance. Asset-, money-, risk- and\ninvestment  management  aim  to  maximize  value  and  minimize  volatility.  Financial  analysis\nassesses  the  viability,  stability,  and  profitability  of  an  action  or  entity.
