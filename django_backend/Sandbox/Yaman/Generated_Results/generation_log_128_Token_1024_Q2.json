This is in contrast to civil law systems, which are based on codes and statutes. The US legal system also has a strong emphasis on individual rights and freedoms, which is not always the case in other legal systems. Additionally, the US legal system is adversarial, meaning that the two sides in a dispute present their cases to a judge or jury, who then makes a decision. This is in contrast to inquisitorial systems, where the judge plays a more active role in investigating the facts of a case."
