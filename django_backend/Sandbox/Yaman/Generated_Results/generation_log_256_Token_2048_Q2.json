[d] Savers and investors have money available which could earn interest or profits on it. Those who need money to fund investments or purchases (borrowers) do so at a cost, called interest or a financial charge. Interest is the income from a loan or deposit added to the loan principal. Someone who owns capital has different loan or deposit options and makes up his or her mind which of the available investment products to choose depending on the information available. In a free market economy, where interest rates are market-determined, the supply and demand of money will eventually drive the interest rate to an equilibrium that will eliminate excess supply or demand. This is what is called the natural rate of interest or real interest rate, r*.\n\nThe rate of interest is the price of capital. It is the reward offered and paid to entice people to make available their savings for investment. This price is determined by the market forces of supply and demand. The market determines the interest rate by seeking the level where the supply of funds from lenders is equal to the demand from borrowers. This rate is also referred to as the \"equilibrium rate of interest\" or just the \"interest rate.\""

                    "answer": "Investing is the act of committing money or capital to an endeavor (a business, project, real estate, etc.) with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit. In an economic sense, an investment is the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used in the future to create wealth. In finance, an investment is a means of generating future benefits. It is money or an asset that is invested in the expectation of some benefit in the future. The purpose of investing is to generate a return on the original amount invested (ROI), either through interest, dividends, or capital gains. The goal of investing is to maximize the return on the investment while minimizing the risk of loss. The return on an investment is calculated by dividing the total return by the original investment amount. The risk of loss is determined by the volatility of the investment, which is measured by the standard deviation of the return. The higher the standard deviation, the greater the risk of loss. The most common types of investments are stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents. Stocks are shares of ownership in a company and represent a claim on the company's assets and earnings. Bonds are debt instruments issued by governments and corporations to raise capital. Cash equivalents are short-term investments that are highly liquid and have a low risk of loss."
