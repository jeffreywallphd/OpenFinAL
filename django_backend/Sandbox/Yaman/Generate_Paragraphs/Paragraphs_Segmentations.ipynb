      "\n",
      "Paragraph 10: Law is a word that means different things at different times. Black’s Law Dictionary says that law is “a \n",
      "body of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force. That \n",
      "which must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 11: In a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual \n",
      "rights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly \n",
      "social change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \n",
      "authoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \n",
      "or political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism,\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 12: European nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \n",
      "those same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Spain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \n",
      "the law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \n",
      "seldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 14: In nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \n",
      "frequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \n",
      "power struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \n",
      "deliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \n",
      "international community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet\n",
