## Introduction  
This design guide defines the visual and interaction standards for the application to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience. It provides guidelines for UI components, typography, colors, and layout to maintain coherence across the app.  

## Design Principles  
The app design follows these core principles:  
- Simplicity & Clarity – The interface should be easy to understand and navigate. Keep it simple and minimalistic.

- Responsiveness – The UI should adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
- Stability - Keep al icons like ChatBot at the same spot for all sections of the application.
