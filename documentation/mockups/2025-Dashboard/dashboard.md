These mockups were crafted over multiple iterations, user discovery interviews, and research. They showcase ideally where we would like the dashboard to be if we were to continue working on it for another semester. We wanted to create an intuitive accessible dashboard with great at a glance information. Ensuring we are following the web content accessibility guidelines [(WCAG)]("https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"), and include disability features. Beyond just the visual and organizational changes we would also like to eventually build in a news feed that is curated to the individual user portfolio. We also would like to have a customizable watch list for stocks that would auto scroll and some general widget esc customization. Lastly, we would like more personalization like the chatbot greeting you upon logging in.
