# GitHub Documentation Key

This guide explains how to convert certain file types so that they display properly on GitHub. Some file types do not render correctly when uploaded directly, so they must be converted before adding them to your repository.

## Important Notes

- **No functional coding files should be uploaded as documentation.**  
  You *can* include code examples inside Markdown (.md) documentation.

- GitHub Markdown uses a specific syntax for code blocks.  
  - Learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)

- If a file type is not viewable in GitHub, **convert or export** it to a supported format **before** uploading and making a pull request.
