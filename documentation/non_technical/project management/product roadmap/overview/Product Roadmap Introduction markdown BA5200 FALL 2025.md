**BA5200 FALL 2025 Product Roadmap** 

Over the next five years, our focus is on building a product that not only responds to current customer needs but anticipates future market shifts, technological changes, and  competitive pressures. This roadmap highlights the major strategic themes, capability investments, and transformational initiatives that will shape the product’s development. While annual  plans and quarterly releases will address detailed execution, this long-range roadmap provides the overarching strategic direction. 

Because no long-term plan can predict every change, this roadmap is a **living document**. It will be reassessed regularly to ensure it remains aligned with customer insights, organizational  goals, and emerging opportunities. Rather than serving as a rigid schedule, it acts as a strategic blueprint that guides decision-making, resource allocation, and cross-team collaboration. This 5-Year Strategic Product Roadmap is built around six core pillars that guide the long-term evolution, stability, and competitiveness of the product. Each pillar represents a  critical dimension of growth, operational excellence, and technological advancement. Together, they establish the structure for annual milestones and ensure the product advances in a  deliberate, scalable, and future-ready manner. 

The following overview introduces each strategic pillar and outlines the major goals that will be pursued across the five-year timeline. These pillars serve as the backbone of the roadmap,  anchoring our decisions in sustainable development, innovation, and alignment with industry standards.  

**1\. External Funding** 

Sustained progress depends on securing consistent financial support. Over the five-year period, this pillar focuses on establishing partnerships, acquiring grants, and scaling funding to  meet the growing needs of the project. Early years emphasize identifying partners and building a funding pipeline, while later years focus on expanding financial resilience. By Year 5, the  goal is to secure at least $100,000 to support the release of Alpha 1.0 and ensure long-term stability. 

**2\. Adaptive Learning** 

This pillar supports the development of a fully adaptive, AI-driven user interface and learning environment. Early priorities focus on building the technical foundation—such as the  sandbox environment, tech stack, componentized UI, and functional specifications. Subsequent years are dedicated to iterative improvement, beta testing, and full implementation of  adaptive capabilities. By Year 5, the product will be fully functional and ready for app store deployment. 

**3\. Innovation & Emerging Technology** 

Innovation is sustained by a structured approach to research and development. This pillar establishes a dedicated R\&D team, standardized processes, and ongoing documentation to support  rapid technological exploration. Over time, R\&D will identify and prototype new features, troubleshoot major product challenges, and integrate cutting-edge technologies. By Year 5,  competitive analysis will guide the adoption of two new capabilities that differentiate the product in the market. 

**4\. Accessibility** 

Ensuring the product meets and exceeds accessibility standards is essential. Initial effort focuses on assessing compliance with WCAG 2.0/2.1 and achieving high-level accessibility  readiness for beta release. Later years expand into identifying gaps in existing guidelines, exploring innovative solutions, and designing interfaces optimized for multiple devices. Year 5  emphasizes rigorous production testing to maintain accessibility at scale. 

**5\. Financial Capabilities** 

This pillar establishes the financial infrastructure required to meet NASDAQ-aligned standards and industry expectations. Early years include external review and building foundational  compliance processes, followed by progressively meeting the requirements. By Year 4, the product aims to achieve at least 50% of competitive industry capabilities. Year 5 introduces a  tiered release strategy—including potential subscription models—and alignment with R\&D to define value-added premium features. 

**6\. Learning Module Development** 

This pillar focuses on building a robust, scalable learning system integrated directly into the product. Early years emphasize development workflows, PowerPoint integration, and the  creation of foundational learning modules. Progression moves from introductory to intermediate and expert modules, while also refining the learning experience through gamification and  assessments. By Year 5, the goal is to initiate steps toward accreditation and continuing education certification, ensuring the learning ecosystem meets professional and academic standards.
