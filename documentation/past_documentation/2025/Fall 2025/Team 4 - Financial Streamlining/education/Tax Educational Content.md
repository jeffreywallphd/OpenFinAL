**Taxation Basics**  
To file taxes each year, an individual must decide what filing status is appropriate for their situation. Most common filing statuses are single and married filing jointly, but head of household, married filing separately, and trusts also exist. You can determine your filing status using the IRS’s Interactive Tax Assistant [HERE](https://itap1.for.irs.gov/owda/0/investigate/FilingStatus_ITA/en-US/ScreenOrder~Main~qs%24f77e468f-4797-44b3-bb42-c0254356f0ba%24global%24global). 

You must also add all sources of income to reach your taxable income. Any money you earn is considered income. Any change in income or financial position may affect your taxable income. Buying or selling investments can change the amount of money you owe each taxable year. Your taxable income may span multiple tax brackets. In this situation, you pay the higher rate on only the portion that is within the income range of that higher tax bracket. 

The following table outlines the 2025 tax due for single taxpayers spanning across multiple tax brackets. Tax brackets for other filers can be found on the IRS website.

| 2025 Tax Bracket for Single Taxpayers |  |
| :---: | :---: |
| **If Taxable Income Is:** | **The Tax Due Is:** |
| $0 \- $11,925 | 10% of taxable income |
| $11,926 \- $48,475 | $1,192.50 \+ 12% of the amount over $11,925 |
| $48,476 \- $103,350 | $5,578.50 \+ 22% of the amount over $48,475 |
| $103,351 \- $197,300 | $17,651 \+ 24% of the amount over $103,350 |
| $197,301 \- $250,525 | $40,199 \+ 32% of the amount over $197,300 |
| $250,526 \- $626,350 | $57,231 \+ 35% of the amount over $250,525 |
| $626,351 and over | $188,769.75 \+ 37% of the amount over $626,350 |

**Capital Gains**  
A capital gain is any profit made from selling an asset. The tax rate depends on how long you hold the investment. These investments could be stocks, bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrencies. 

A short-term gain occurs when you sell an asset you’ve held for one year or less. This gain would be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. A long-term gain occurs when you sell an asset that has been held for more than one year. Long-term gains are important, because they result in preferential tax outcomes. These gains are taxed at a lower rate, which results in a lower tax liability. Depending on your taxable income, these gains can be taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%. The tax is calculated by the amount that exceeds each bracket. 

For example, a single filer with taxable income of $50,000 would be taxed at 0% for the first $47,025 of their income and taxed at 15% for the remaining portion of their income. They would effectively be taxed $446 ($2,975 x 15%) due to the $2,975 that exceeds the first bracket.

Refer to the following table to assess your capital gains tax rate:

| 2025 Capital Gains Tax Rates |  |  |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Tax Rate** | **Single** | **Married Filing Seperately** | **Married Filing Jointly** | **Head of Household** |
| **0%** | $0 \- $47,025 | $0 \- $47,025 | $0 \- $94,050 | $0 \- $63,000 |
| **15%** | $47,026 \- $518,900 | $47,026 \- $291,850 | $94,051 \- $583,750 | $63,001 \- $551,350 |
| **20%** | $518,901 and up | $291,851 and up | $583,751 and up | $551,351 and up |

***Example 1\)*** If you have a $30,000 yearly salary and made $10,000 from selling long-term investments, your taxable income would be $40,000. If your filing status is single, your capital gains tax rate would be 0%. Therefore, you would not have to pay any tax on profits made through those investments. Instead, imagine you had made $25,000 in profits from selling those long-term investments. In this situation, your capital gains tax rate would be 15% for the income exceeding $47,025. This would result in a tax payment of $2,696 ($65,000 \- $47,025 \= $17,975 x 15%).

***Example 2\)*** You bought a stock for $1,000 and sold it for $1,500 after 11 months, realizing a $500 profit. If your ordinary income tax rate is 22%, you will owe $110 in taxes due to this short-term gain ($500 x 22%). However, if you had held the stock for over a year, your long-term capital gains tax might be lower, depending on your tax bracket. 

**Capital Losses**  
A capital loss is a loss incurred from selling an asset. Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains to reduce your tax liability. Currently, up to *$3,000* of capital losses can be used to offset capital gains. Any remaining capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely. This means that these losses can be carried forward to a subsequent tax year to offset capital gains in the future. These losses do not expire and can be effectively carried forward forever. 

***Example 1\)*** You, a single filer, have a $30,000 yearly salary and made $19,000 from selling long-term investments, but you also incurred a $4,000 loss on a speculative asset. $3,000 of that loss can be used to offset the $10,000 capital gain. Without the capital loss, your taxable income would be $49,000 and you would need to pay $296 in taxes. With the loss, your taxable income would be $46,000 which is wholly in the 0% bracket. 

[Form 1099-B](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-b) reports sales of investments from a broker to calculate capital gains and losses. 

*For further information on capital gains/losses, the following link to the IRS Topic no. 409 goes into more detail. \[[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409)\]*

**Unrealized vs. Realized**  
It is common for stocks and other financial instruments to change value over time. However,this change should only be accounted for once the asset has been sold. Once sold, any profit or loss is fully realized. Prior to sale, any value change is unrealized. Only realized gains or losses can affect your tax situation. A recognized gain is the portion of realized gain that the IRS considers taxable in that year.

***Example)*** If you buy a stock at $100 and later sell it at $120, your realized gain would be $20 and would affect your taxes. If you have not yet sold the stock, the $20 gain would be unrealized and have no effect on your taxes. 

**Dividends**  
Dividends are a way for companies to share profits with investors. Not all companies pay dividends, but those that do generally pay on a quarterly basis. A one-time or other special dividend may also be announced. Dividends can also be paid in additional shares and are called a stock dividend. If a company that normally pays dividends stops or delays payments, this is usually a signal to investors that the company is undergoing liquidity issues. 

A qualified dividend can be eligible for favorable tax treatment under capital gains rates. To be eligible, the dividend must meet specific [holding period conditions](https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/qualified-dividends). The investor must hold the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date (the date an investor must own the stock to receive the dividend). You will receive a Form 1099-DIV from each company that has paid you at least $10 in dividends.

**Interest**  
Certain financial instruments incur interest that is paid to the owner of the asset. Some sources of interest may be derived from savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and bonds. Generally, any interest received is taxed at the same rate as other sources of income. However, some sources of interest may be tax-exempt and not subject to any tax. These sources include municipal bonds, education savings accounts, and some retirement accounts. 

Your financial institution will provide you a Form 1099-INT if you earned $10 or loss in interest during the year. No matter the amount of taxable or tax-exempt interest earned, you are required to report any interest received on your federal tax return. If your taxable interest exceeds $1,500, you must fill out Schedule B.

*For further information on interest, the following link to the IRS Topic no. 403 goes into more detail. \[[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc403](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc403)\]*  
**Tax Filing**  
The following table outlines some common tax forms that are important to understand. 

| Common Tax Forms |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| 1099 \- DIV | Reports dividends, qualified & ordinary |
| 1099 \- INT | Reports interest income |
| 1099 \- B | Reports gains & losses from securities sales |
| Form 8949 & Schedule D | Summarizes capital gains & losses |
| 1099 \- R | Reports distributions from retirement accounts |

**How to Minimize Your Tax Liability**  
One of the most useful ways an investor can maximize their profits is to lower their tax liability. Directly, this can be done by leveraging lower capital gains rates. To do so, investments should be held for over a year to qualify for this preferential treatment. 

Additionally, certain investment accounts also induce tax advantages. Accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s can defer or avoid taxes on investment gains. Consider exploring tax-loss harvesting options, which involve strategically selling investments at a loss. These losses can offset gains made from other investments and can reduce your taxable income.

**Taxable Investment Income**  
As you increase your tax knowledge, it’s important to understand that not all investment income is treated the same way by the IRS. Different types of income have different tax rules.

Interest income is considered ordinary income and is taxed at your regular income tax rate. Sources can include savings accounts, bonds, and certificates of deposits (CDs). For example, if you're in the 22% tax bracket and you earn $100 in interest, you’ll owe $22 in taxes on that amount.

Capital gains, which occur when you sell an investment for more than you paid, can be either short-term or long-term. If you hold the asset for one year or less before selling, your profit is a short-term gain and taxed as ordinary income. If you hold it for more than one year, it becomes a long-term gain and is taxed at a lower, preferential rate. These rates can either be 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your taxable income.

***Example)*** You bought a stock for $1,000 and sold it for $1,400. If you held it for 10 months, the $400 profit is short-term and would be taxed at your regular rate. If you held it for 14 months, it would qualify as a long-term gain and likely be taxed at 15% or even 0%, depending on your taxable income.

*For further information on interest, the following link to the IRS Topic no. 403 goes into more detail. \[[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc403](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc403)\]*  
**Selling Strategies**  
When you buy the same investment multiple times, each purchase is considered a different tax lot. A tax lot is created each time you buy shares of a security. When you later sell part of your investment, the price you originally paid for the shares (the cost basis) determines how much gain or loss you have.

The IRS generally assumes you sell your oldest shares first. This situation is referred to as FIFO: first-in, first-out. As in, the first security you bought will be the first one you sell. However, you can choose another method to potentially reduce your tax bill. This strategy becomes more useful as your portfolio grows and your investing decisions become more complex.

***Example)*** Suppose you buy 10 shares of a stock at $50 and another 10 shares later at $70. If you then sell 10 shares when the price is $90, you can choose whether to sell the lower-cost $50 shares or the higher-cost $70 shares. Selling the $70 shares would result in a smaller taxable gain ($200 vs. $400), lowering your taxes.

**Qualified Dividends vs. Ordinary Dividends**  
Some companies reward shareholders by paying dividends, either in cash or additional shares. However, not all dividends are taxed the same way. Qualified dividends are taxed at the lower capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%), while ordinary dividends are taxed at your regular income rate. You will receive this dividend information each year on a Form 1099-DIV, which will tell you exactly how much of your dividends were considered qualified.

The holding criteria that must be met for dividends to be considered qualified are: 

1. The company must be a U.S. corporation or a qualifying foreign company

2. You must hold the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period surrounding the ex-dividend date (the date by which you must own the stock to get the dividend)

***Example)*** If you bought a dividend-paying stock and sold it just two weeks later, the dividend you received would likely be ordinary and taxed at a higher rate. However, if you held that stock for a few months or longer, the dividend would likely be qualified, meaning you’d pay less tax on it.

**Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
Tax-advantaged accounts are designed to help you save and invest more efficiently by reducing the taxes you pay. The most common of these are Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and 401(k)s.

With a Traditional IRA or 401(k), you can often deduct your contributions from your taxable income, reducing your tax liability today. However, when you withdraw money in retirement, it’s taxed as ordinary income. With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, but your money grows tax-free and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. However, you must follow certain rules or you may have to pay a penalty. These accounts also have contribution limits and rules about when you can withdraw funds, but they are useful tools for long-term wealth building.

Additionally, a 529 Plan is a tax-advantaged investment account that helps to pay for educational expenses. Any growth of the money invested is generally income tax-free as long as the money is used for qualified expenses, such as tuition and supplies. 

***Example)*** You invested $5,000 into a Roth IRA that will grow to $25,000 by retirement age. You do not get a tax break today, but you won’t owe any tax on those gains once you reach retirement. In contrast, if you used a regular brokerage account, you’d likely owe capital gains taxes on that growth.

**Capital Losses**  
Not all investments result in a gain. Sometimes, you may sell an asset for less than you paid, resulting in a capital loss. These losses can be used to offset capital gains, reducing your overall tax liability. For example, if you made $3,000 in profits on one stock but lost $1,000 on another, you’d only owe taxes on the net $2,000 gain. If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, you can deduct up to $3,000 of those losses from your regular income. Any leftover losses can be carried forward indefinitely, reducing your tax liability in future years.

However, if you sell an investment at a loss and repurchase the same (or substantially identical) security within 30 days, the IRS will disallow this loss. This means you can’t use the intial loss to lower your tax bill that year. This rule is called the Wash Sale Rule. 

***Example)*** You sell shares of a stock at a $2,000 loss on October 1 and buy it back on October 15\. This would be considered a wash sale because it was repurchased within the 30-day time period. Therefore, the $2,000 loss can’t be claimed on your taxes to offset any capital gains. 

**Tax Filing**  
The following table describes some useful tax forms beyond those that are most commonly used.

| Additional Tax Forms |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| Form 5498 | Info about transactions in IRAs |
| Form 5498 \- ESA | Info about contributions to ESAs |
| Form  1099 \-  OID | Reports taxable interest income from certain debt instruments |
| Schedule K \- 1 | Details income share for partnerships or S corporations |
| Schedule B | File if taxable interest exceeds $1,500 |
| Form 1099 \- Q | Reports distributions from 529 plan or ESA |

**Tax Guidance**  
As your investing knowledge and profits grow, your taxes may become more complex. While many people file taxes on their own, there are situations where working with a tax professional may save you money and frustration.

Some situations where you might want to consult an expert are when:

* You have multiple investment accounts across different platforms

* You invest in options, real estate, or cryptocurrencies

* You receive dividends from international stocks

* You’re unsure how to report tax-loss harvesting or complex trades

Sources of tax help can come from online preparation services, free volunteer programs, the IRS itself, CPAs, and tax attorneys.

**Strategic Tax Management**  
As you become a more experienced investor, tax efficiency becomes a key part of maximizing returns. Understanding how to actively manage taxes through timing, asset selection, and account placement can make a substantial difference to your long-term wealth. At this level, you should be familiar with basic tax structures and now shift to strategic decision-making.

**Holding Period Optimization**

The timing of when you sell an investment can significantly affect your tax liability. Long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably than short-term gains, so managing your holding periods is one of the easiest ways to reduce taxes. Long-term planning around sale dates, especially near year-end, can meaningfully reduce your tax liability.

***Example)*** You bought shares of a stock for $5,000, and 11 months later, it’s worth $7,000. If you sell now, the $2,000 profit is short-term and taxed at your ordinary income rate. If your tax rate is 24%, you’ll owe $480 in taxes. But if you wait one more month, it becomes a long-term capital gain, potentially taxed at just 15%. This results in owing only $300 in taxes, saving you $180.

**Tax-Loss Harvesting**  
As your portfolio grows, you’ll likely encounter both gains and losses. Rather than avoiding losses, use them to your advantage. Selling investments at a loss can offset gains from other investments, reducing your overall taxable income. You can deduct up to $3,000 in capital losses against ordinary income if your losses exceed gains. The rest can be carried forward indefinitely.

***Example)*** You sold a stock for a $6,000 gain, but you also have another stock down $4,000. If you harvest that loss, your net gain is only $2,000, reducing your tax owed. If you had no gains to offset, you could still deduct $3,000 against your income and carry the rest forward.

***Be careful of the wash sale rule: if you repurchase the same or a substantially identical asset within 30 days, the IRS will disallow the loss.***

**Tax-Efficient Portfolio**  
Not all accounts are taxed the same. Placing the right investments in the right type of account can minimize taxes.

* **Tax-advantaged accounts**: IRAs & 401ks are best for assets with high income.  
* **Taxable accounts**: Better for growth assets with long-term gains and qualified dividends.

***Example)*** You hold a bond fund generating 5% interest annually and a growth stock ETF. If you place the bond fund in a traditional IRA (deferred taxes) and the ETF in a taxable account ( long-term capital gains), you’ll likely reduce your annual tax exposure while benefiting from long-term appreciation.

**Qualified Dividends and Tax Treatment**  
Qualified dividends are still taxed at capital gains rates, but at this level, you should know how to position your dividend-paying assets based on your income level and filing status.

Important Considerations:

* The holding period requirement (60+ days in a 121-day window)

* Whether the dividend is from a qualified corporation

* How dividends affect your taxable income thresholds for capital gains

**Example)** You receive $5,000 in qualified dividends and $60,000 in other income. Your total income of $65,000 means your dividends fall within the 15% capital gains bracket. However, had your income been lower, some dividends could have qualified for 0% taxation.

**Advanced Tax Considerations**  
As your investing grows more complex, there are additional strategies and concepts to keep in mind. Many additional rules only apply to high earners or financially diverse portfolios and are described below. 

The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) requires high earners to owe an additional 3.8% on investment income if modified AGI exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing jointly). The 3.8% tax is applied to the lessor of your investment income for the year or the amount by which your MAGI exceeds your filing status threshold. Sources of investment income include interest, dividends, capital gains, and passive investments.

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) ensures that high earners pay a minimum amount of tax. Taxpayers must calculate their tax liability under regular and AMT rules and pay the higher amount. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the number of those affected by AMT, but those with high income, larged itemized deductions, incentive stock options, or certain tax-exempt interest may still be affected. The AMT has two progressive tax rates of 26% and 28%. 

If you invest in international funds or ADRs, you may pay foreign taxes. These can often be claimed as a credit against U.S. taxes via Form 1116\. To qualify for the Foreign Tax Credit, the foreign taxes must be from a foreign country and derive from income or excess profits. This credit is advantageous because foreign income taxes reduce your U.S. taxable income. 

**Tax Filing and Documentation**  
Make sure your brokerage’s cost basis tracking is accurate, especially if you transfer shares between platforms or use specific lot sales.

**When to Consult a Tax Pro**  
Even confident investors benefit from working with tax professionals, especially if:

* You’re selling appreciated private stock or exercising options

* You have large carryforward losses

* You invest in K-1 generating securities (like certain ETFs or LPs)

* You use advanced strategies like backdoor Roth IRAs or donor-advised funds (DAFs)

A CPA or tax consultant can help you plan proactively, not just file reactively.

# Expert (4 pts)

At the expert level, tax efficiency becomes a dynamic, year-round discipline. You are likely managing diverse assets—such as real estate, private equity, international investments, and derivatives—and need to navigate advanced tax rules that go beyond simple gains and losses. The goal isn’t just minimizing tax today, but optimizing across years, asset types, and structures. This requires integrating tax planning into your portfolio design, estate planning, and charitable giving strategies.

**Proactive Tax Bracket Management**  
Experienced investors actively manage not just what they earn, but when they realize income. By controlling income recognition, such as timing capital gains, Roth conversions, or IRA withdrawals, you can stay within favorable tax brackets or even avoid costly surcharges.

**Example)** You’re approaching the 15% long-term capital gains bracket limit. Selling appreciated assets now would push you into the 20% bracket and potentially trigger Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). By instead selling part this year and the rest in January, you spread the gain across two tax years and stay under the threshold. Other tactics include deferring income until retirement or low-income years, and accelerating deductions in high-income years.

**Strategic Use of Entity Structures**  
At this level, you may benefit from using entity structures to protect assets, manage liability, and optimize tax:

* **LLCs & LPs** for real estate or private investments  
* **S-Corps** to split income into wages vs. distributions  
* **C-Corps** in unique high-growth scenarios, often with exit strategy planning

Additionally, advanced investors leverage tax-advantaged accounts beyond the basics:

* **Backdoor Roth IRAs**: Allows high earners to contribute despite income limits.  
* **Mega Backdoor Roths**: Through 401(k) plans enable contributions exceeding $60,000 annually.  
* **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**: Provide triple tax benefits for medical costs and can be invested long-term.

**Asset Location Optimization Across Portfolios**  
At this point, asset allocation (what you invest in) must be paired with asset location (where you hold each asset). The idea is to place tax-inefficient investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts, and tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts. The following table gives some best practices for different types of investments.

| Asset Type | Best Location |
| ----- | ----- |
| Bonds / REITs | Tax-deferred (IRA/401(k)) |
| Dividend Stocks | Roth IRA (if qualified) |
| Growth Stocks | Taxable (for long-term gains) |
| Alternatives (LPs, private equity) | LLCs or trusts |

**Example)** You place a REIT in a Traditional IRA to avoid annual taxation on high-yield income. Meanwhile, you hold high-growth tech stocks in a taxable account, benefiting from long-term capital gains rates.

**Advanced Tax-Loss Harvesting & Gain Harvesting**  
You may already be harvesting losses, but advanced strategies include:

* **Tax Gain Harvesting** in low-income years to reset cost basis without tax impact.  
* **Pairing Losses and Gains Across Accounts or Asset Classes.**  
* **Synthetic Loss Harvesting**: Sell an asset at a loss and buy a similar (but not identical) one to maintain exposure while avoiding a wash sale.

**Example)** You hold an ETF that’s down $10,000. You sell it to capture the loss, then immediately purchase a similar ETF in the same sector. This maintains market exposure while reducing your tax liability by $2,400 if you’re in the 24% bracket.

**Charitable Giving as a Tax Strategy**  
Philanthropy can be a powerful tax tool when integrated strategically:

* **Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs):** Allow you to donate appreciated assets, avoid capital gains, and get an immediate deduction while distributing grants over time.  
* **Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs):** For investors 70½+, you can donate up to $100,000 directly from an IRA to charity. This satisfies RMDs and reduces taxable income.  
* **Gifting Appreciated Assets Directly:** Instead of selling and donating cash, donate the appreciated asset to avoid capital gains and deduct the fair market value.

**Example)** You donate $50,000 of stock bought for $10,000 to a DAF. You avoid paying tax on the $40,000 gain and deduct the full $50,000 if itemizing.

**Estate Planning & Wealth Transfer Efficiency**  
At this level, estate planning is not just about who inherits your wealth, but how they inherit it tax-efficiently.

* **Step-up in Basis Rule**: At death, heirs receive assets at their current market value, eliminating capital gains.  
* **Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs) & Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs)**: Used to transfer appreciating assets with reduced estate tax exposure.  
* **Annual Exclusion Gifts**: $18,000 per recipient in 2025 and   
* **Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption:** $13.61 million in 2025 per individual to transfer wealth tax-efficiently.  
* **Federal Estate & Gift Tax Exemption**: Will increase to $15 million per individual in 2026\. Any amount over this limit will be subject to the 40% federal estate tax rate. 

**Complex Reporting & Tax Filing Considerations**  
With multiple accounts, entities, and strategies, your tax filing may involve the following forms and schedules. 

| Advanced Tax Forms |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| Form 1116 | Foreign tax credits |
| Schedule K-1 | Partnerships and trusts |
| Form 8606 | Non-deductible IRA contributions and Roth conversions |

It is critical to maintain accurate cost basis records, especially if you use specific identification or transfer assets between platforms.

**When to Work with a Tax Advisor or Wealth Manager**  
At this level, working with a CPA or tax-focused financial advisor isn’t optional, but rather essential. These experts can:

* Help model scenarios around sale timing, Roth conversions, or capital gain harvesting.  
* Assist in estate planning and charitable giving strategies.
