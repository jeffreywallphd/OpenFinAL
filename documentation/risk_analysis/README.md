# Risk Analysis Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides information on the Risk Analysis page for the OpenFinAL project.
The risk analysis page can be edited in the Analysis.jsx file and any UI changes that need to be made can be edited in the index.css file.
Note: the index.css folder is how everyone edits some of their UI features, so be careful when editing.

Features added spring 2025:
1. Fixed math for the risk ratios column
2. Added "clear" buttons to clear info in your info and diversification
3. Fixed pie chart in diversification to properly display colors in tandem to math
4. Added a hover over feature to display info when hovering over any word or abreviation on page
Biggest change:
1. FIXED THE UI (its so pretty now).

There are a couple bugs left that should be noted which are all relatively small:
1. The page has a weird sizing issue which can be band-aided by hovering over the view section at the top of the page and zooming in if you have to
2. The page also has an odd scrolling bug likely do to the weird sizing
3. The colors on the page don't match up with the style guide
4. The math for the pie chart may not be correct
Other things that came up in interviws:
1. The text boxes could be a little bigger
2. The spacing between columns is slightly too much

Features not included yet:
1. The your info section is planned to eventually pull from the portfolio page
2. A What if function similar to that of the grading section on canvas is planned to swap between info from portfolio and whatever you want to put into the your info section on risk analysis page
