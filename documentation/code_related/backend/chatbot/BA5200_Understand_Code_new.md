# 1\. Read the Guides

- [ ] [Best coding practice](https://github.com/jeffreywallphd/OpenFinAL/blob/main/guides/BestCodingPractices.md)  
- [ ] [Git usage](https://github.com/jeffreywallphd/OpenFinAL/blob/main/guides/GITUSAGE.md)  
- [ ] [LLM](https://github.com/jeffreywallphd/OpenFinAL/blob/main/guides/LLMS_TRANSFORMERS_HUGGINGFACE_SCOPE_NODEJS.md)

# 2\. Comment Code

- [ ] Folder structure  
- [ ] AI Chatbox UI  
- [ ] LLM back-end

# 3\. Choose Development Path(s)

- [ ] Focus on LLM: Develop a specific financial education LLM model, then integrate the question-answer feature into the software.  
      - [ ] [Fine-tuning](https://github.com/jeffreywallphd/OpenFinAL/blob/main/prototypes/Fall2024/Team5_Chat_AI_Assistance/Appdev-Prototypes/Model%20Training/Model_Training_Updated.ipynb) existing LLM  
      - [ ] GenAI: news API \+ [retrieval-augmented generation](https://www.k2view.com/blog/rag-genai/#No-Real-Time-Data-A-Key-GenAI-Challenge)  
- [ ] Focus on software knowledge retrieval: [queries related to relational databases](https://www.k2view.com/blog/rag-genai/#The-Benefits-of-RAG-for-GenAI) in software.  
      - [ ] Software navigation  
      - [ ] Answer questions about risk management, portfolio recommendations, and the 10-K.  
* Essentials for either path:  
* Data security and privacy.  
* The software chatbot can respond to questions.  
* Chat history.

# 4\. Questions/Tasks for the Next Sprint

- [ ] Management side: Interview, what questions are they most frequently asked in life, and GenAI?  
- [ ] Technical side: Research, preselecting Hugging Face models (less than 3B). See the attachment for the computing resources Jeff provides [Jeff Reply-Computing Resources for the NLP Model.pdf](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qdzZczQNfzd0G2rZrH6RXFHfhr8ylHZP).  
- [ ] Technical aspect: Generate a universal public token for the entire software group. Some 3B model does not need a token.
