# Branch Management Guide

This guide outlines which branches **must NOT be deleted**, which require **instructor approval**, and which are **safe to delete after merge**.

---

## 🚫 Branches That MUST NOT Be Deleted  
These branches represent **active or incomplete feature work from the previous semester**. They must remain until they are **fully tested and merged into `main`**.

```text
ALL2024-BA5200-Team3
FALL2025-BA5200-Financial-Streamlining
FALL2025-BA5200-RiskManagement
FALL2025-BA5200-Team1
FALL2025-BA5200-Team2
FALL2025-BA5200-Team3
FALL2025-BA5200-Team4
FALL2025-BA5200-Team5
```
---

## Team & Semester Branch Naming Convention

Team branches follow this structure:

```text
semesterYYYY-coursenumber-team#
```
or

```text
semesterYYYY-coursenumber-teamname
```

### Examples:
- `FALL2025-BA5200-Team1`
- `FALL2025-BA5200-Team3`
- `FALL2025-BA5200-Financial-Streamlining`
- `FALL2025-BA5200-RiskManagement`

### Notes:
- Used for **team or group assignments** within a semester.
- The ending may be a team number or a descriptive team name.
- When duplicates exist across semesters, the **most recent semester’s version** is the active one.
- These branches **must not be deleted without instructor approval**.

---

## Stale or Legacy Branches (Instructor Approval Required Before Deletion)

These branches are tied to **past semesters, earlier versions of the course, or old project cycles**.  
They may no longer be needed, but **must not be deleted without confirmation from the instructor**.

### Examples:
```text
SPRING2024-br-react-all-comps-2
SPRING2024-br-react-all-comps
MIS4000_Database
FALL2024-Scraping_API
Risk-Analysis-Spring-2025
```
---

## Special Case: Branches Containing “wall”
Any branch with **“wall”** in its name should **NOT be deleted**, as it typically indicates the instructor was making changes. Unless the instructor permits you.

Examples:
```text
wall-changes
wall-updates
wall-<anything>
```
---

## ✔️ Branches Safe to Delete After Successful Merge  
These can be deleted once their PR (Pull Request) is merged *and* the author has not requested preservation.

### Individual contributor branches examples:
```text
aireynexxx-patch-1
<username>-patch-1
```
- Auto-generated or one-off development branches.
- Safe to delete following a completed PR.

### PR(Pull Request)-specific branches examples:
```text
pr-306
pr/tperr/326
```
### Fix branches examples:
```text
fix/light-dark-mode-toggle-label
fix/missing-learning-modules
fix/rename_snp500
fix/risk-schema-changes
fix/snp500-migration_file
```

## Main Branch

- The primary production branch.  
- All stable, complete work must eventually be merged here.

---

## General Rules

### 1. **Do NOT delete any branch unless:**
- The branch has been fully merged, **and**
- The author did not request it be kept, **and**
- It is not a semester/team branch, **and**
- It does not include the instructor’s name (`wall`), **and**
- It is not a legacy branch needing instructor approval.

### 2. **Always ask the instructor before deleting:**
- Any semester/team branch (e.g., `FALL2025-BA5200-Team3`)
- Any branch from older semesters (e.g., `SPRING2024-*`)
- Any branch with “wall” in the name  
- Any unclear or historical branch

### 3. **Patch branches**
- Named like `username-patch-1`  
- Auto-generated by GitHub  
- Safe to delete after merge
