## What is a Pull Request in GitHub?
A Pull Request (PR) is an action in GitHub that involves submitting a file or some form of content to the GitHub repository. Simply put, any new content to be incorporated into our class's GitHub repository must go through a Pull Request.

## Utilizing Pull Requests in GitHub
* To get started with making a pull request, navigate to the directory where you would like to make this new file or put some new content. For instance, if I want to create a new page in the "open-fin-al" folder, I will begin by clicking on the "open-fin-al" folder.

* Next, click the "Add File" button in the upper right corner.

* After clicking on the "Add File" button, you will get a dropdown menu asking if you would like to "Create new file" or "Upload files"; click on either option that applies to your case.

* If you select the "Create new file" button, you'll be brought to a new page containing two boxes. The top box is for naming your file, and the next box is where your syntax will go. After filling out the title box and the content/syntax box, you can press the green "Commit changes..." button in the upper right-hand corner.

* This next section will contain the final proposed changes. From here, you will write your commit message in the top box, expand on what your file contains, and then press the "Propose changes" button.

* If you selected the "Upload files" button, you'll be brought to a new page containing a section to upload a file from your computer and a title and description box below that.

* Once you click "Propose changes," there are a few additional steps that need to be taken. Firstly, in order for reviewers to fully gauge what you changed and why, a form needs to be filled out. To note, a template of this form is accessible in this folder; it is the only other remaining file in the "pullrequests" folder. So, revert to this pull request template once you have proposed changes. This template includes step-by-step instructions, but it is fairly self-explanatory. The only point to be made is that near the end of the template, a few boxes need to be selected. When doing this in real time, simply type an "X" to indicate that a statement is true. 
* Additionally, you have the option to type a title and description for your pull request. Beneath that, there will be two boxes to select, one of which allows you to send to "main branch;" do not submit pull requests to the main branch unless you are specifically instructed to do so. Lastly, you will need to assign a reviewer to your pull request; this is the person responsible for reviewing your changes, providing feedback, and approving the merge. Now, you will be able to create your pull request. At that point, your pull request will be submitted, and your reviewer will be notified automatically.
